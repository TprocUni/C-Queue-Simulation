# C-Queue-Simulation
This project implements a **C-based traffic simulation system** using queue data structures to model vehicle behavior and diagnostic functions to evaluate traffic efficiency. The system tracks vehicle arrival, waiting, and clearance times, simulating traffic flow under varying conditions such as arrival rates and traffic light timings.
